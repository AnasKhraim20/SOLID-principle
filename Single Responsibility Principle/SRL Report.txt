As we know in Single Responsibility Principle,
 there is a class in which there are many functions.
 The articulations that are related or related to the same topic are placed in the same class.
 As for the art in a class that has nothing to do with it or that it talks about another topic,
 we do a class that is specific to that function,
 or sometimes It is preferable that we do a better interface, 
when this function is used only rarely

Based on this rule, I processed the code,
 as I had a class called Info that carried a lot of functions related to operations on Database,
 returning email, and others.
 I created a class for both the email sending process and the communication processes with Database.
