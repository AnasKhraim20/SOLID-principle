the classes (Limited Costumer class) cannot be subsituted for (CostumerA)
that mean when using the costumer class the code dosent work 
if the subClass (Limited) is passed

it was avoided by making a class CustomerA that contains the functions
 and both classes limited Customer , CustomerB are inherited from it
 then simple changes to the override functions
